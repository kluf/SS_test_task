Test task:

-       implement HTML page and style it with CSS for screenshot attached. There should be no visual differences between screenshot and your page. Links should take you to google.com;

-       use div styling instead of tables;

-       images can be cut directly from the screenshot, no need to draw them yourself;

-       try to use Java Script for implementing some feature (for example – link some action like text highlighting to any drop down list, or make review stars clickable);

-       web page should be resized dynamically when you resize browser’s window (width should be 100%). Minimal supported resolution should be 800x600 pixels –page should not resize further if width/height are less than these values but scrolling should be visible instead;

-       browsers to verify pages in: IE9.0, FF6, Google Chrome;

-       you should not use inline styling. All styling has to be moved into external CSS file;

-       do not use any web development application (for example Dreamweaver). The best HTML editor is Notepad++, Firebug, etc.
